**Integrixa** is a **Windows-only**, CLI-based **defensive cybersecurity tool** designed to help system administrators and security-conscious users **monitor file integrity in real time**.  
It runs as a **persistent background daemon**, constantly watching for unauthorized file changes using **SHA-256 cryptographic hashing**. Upon detecting tampering, it sends **instant Telegram alerts** and logs the event for forensic review. Integrixa interacts with the Windows operating system using Python's built-in modules like os, os.path, hashlib, ctypes,psutil, subprocess, and datetime, enabling file path validation, system privilege checks, secure file I/O, daemon-like behavior, and automated task scheduling.

## üîß What It Does

-  Monitors user-specified and default critical system file paths
-  Detects unauthorized modifications using SHA-256 hash comparisons
-  Sends real-time **Telegram alerts** on file tampering
-  Provides an **admin-authenticated CLI** interface for secure management
-  Maintains logs for:
    - Authentication attempts  
    - File monitoring activity  
    - Telegram alerts (successful & failed)
-  **Self-monitors** to resist unauthorized shutdown or tampering
-  Auto-starts monitoring daemon on every system boot
-  Automatically purges all logs older than **2 days**

## üöÄ Getting Started

To install and use Integrixa:

1. Download and Extract the Package:
   - Download Integrixa_Package.zip from the Release v1 section and extract it.
   - After extraction. ensure the folder structure is as follow:
      - The main folder should contain Integrixa.exe
      - Inside the main folder, there should be a service subfolder containing: monitor.exe and watchdog.exe
2. Double click the Integrixa.exe file to begin setup:
    - Set your User ID and Password
    - Configure your Telegram Bot ID and Chat ID
    - Add the file paths you want to monitor
    - Choose to start monitoring.
3. Done! Monitoring will now begin automatically on every system boot.
  - This setup creates two background processes:
    - monitor.exe- Monitor the specified files for any changes. 
    - watchdog.exe - Ensures that monitor.exe is always running. If it stops or crashes watchdog.exe automatically restarts it and sends a Telegram alert.
    - This mechanism ensures tamper-proof, continous file integrity monitoring.
