**FileSentinel** is a **Windows-only**, CLI-based **defensive cybersecurity tool** designed to help system administrators and security-conscious users **monitor file integrity in real time**.  
It runs as a **persistent background daemon**, constantly watching for unauthorized file changes using **SHA-256 cryptographic hashing**. Upon detecting tampering, it sends **instant Telegram alerts** and logs the event for forensic review.
